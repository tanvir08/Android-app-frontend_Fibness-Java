The backend part is in the following [repository](https://github.com/tanvir08/Android-app-backend_Fibness-Nodejs_SQL). The PES (Software Engineering Project) course has been taken in 2020-Q2, spring season. 

The project is based on the creation of a mobile application focused on organizing people's daily sports habits. The **Fibness application** has two main goals. On the one hand, it focuses on motivating and encouraging the practice of sports. On the other hand, in improving the health, physical condition and social communication of users. The **Fibness developer team** is
